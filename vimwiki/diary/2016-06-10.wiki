diary for 10 June 2016

this is dumb
i really cannot believe I am doing this
Mom does not understand that my issues are not priority based
ADHD is an execution disorder -- all ideas, no execution
are diaries supposed to be stream of consciousness? i think that's what I'm going with regardless
house -- i'm not all guys
went to lunch with Nick from work today, he seems way more insightful than I thought at first blush
	also way more willing to be real than most people. Actaully a pretty cool dude
i am afraid to commit stuff to writing. possibly some major trust issues
i have no reason to believe someone would breach my privacy to the degree 
	required to make committing to this diary a bad idea
	and yet I do the things I do
do i trust myself? not quite sure
counter out of shield is super troll
wonder how it stacks up with other OOS options? it comes out like frame 10 oos
