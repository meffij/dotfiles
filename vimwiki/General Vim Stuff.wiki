[[StackOverflow cheat sheet]]


= COOL STUFF =
:shell starts a whole shell
:suspend drops you back to the shell you launched vim from, fg takes you back

= BUFFERS =
:ls lists all buffers (see :help :ls)
:[N] b or :b [N] opens buffer number N in current window
:[N]bd deletes buffers
	this should be unnecessary most of the time except to reduce clutter and free memory

= SESSIONS =
:mks [file] writes vim script to restore session. [file] default is Session.vim
vim -S [file] restores session
seems like sometimes the highlighting from the last search is preserved

= MULTIPLE CURSORS =
is not a thing in vim, use visual block select, find-change -> gn-change -> . to
  do the same thing to multiple selections
  
= MACROS =
start by pressing q, then a register { a - z }
stop by pressing q in normal mode
execute by pressing @{ a - z }


= WINDOW NAVIGATION =
CTRL-W controls windows
CTRL-W w or CTRL-W CTRL-W switches windows
CTRL-W plus direction moves that direction
CTRL-W = makes windows equal size
CTRL-b moves to last window

= FILE NAVIGATION =
:sp[lit] [file] splits horizontally
:vs [file] splits vertically
CTRL-O takes you back
CTRL-I is the counterpart to CTRL-O
